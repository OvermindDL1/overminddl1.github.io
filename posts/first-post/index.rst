Greetings, it's been suggested by many people that I should make a blog to
better document what I do in my various projects and to help people setup
various integrations between things.

Most recently my work coding focus has been on Elixir with dabblings in a few
other things.  At home I touch a little of everything.  If there is anything
that anyone wants clarified on or a dedicated post(s) on then please state.  :-)
